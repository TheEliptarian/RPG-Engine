v0.2 - Update 1
{
	Date - July 21st, 2017
	
	Added a basic main menu, and the ability to roll stats for a character. Added a class system,
	and overhauled the stats system. Stats currently work similar to Fire Emblem in how they each
	stat has a random chance to increase at each level. Also began adding support for map locations,
	like Towns and Wilds. More in the future...
